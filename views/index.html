                    <p frameborder="0" class="w-full h-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">The article from Business Standard reports that former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel claimed authorities did not permit Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's helicopter to land in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, where he was scheduled to attend a rally. Baghel suggested that the BJP was behind the denial due to fear of Gandhi. However, the district administration refuted these claims, stating that the permission for the helipad was granted on May 16 after a request from Congress candidate Tanuj Punia. They added that Punia later canceled the program, and permission was subsequently given for Baghel's rally on May 18. The District Magistrate released correspondence between Punia and the administration to support their statement. This incident occurred in the context of the upcoming voting in Barabanki on May 20, part of the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections.</p>

                    <p frameborder="0" class="w-full h-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">The article from Business Standard reports that a Delhi court has scheduled May 20 to consider the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) supplementary chargesheet against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in connection with a money laundering case related to the 2021-22 Delhi excise policy. The ED alleges that Kejriwal demanded a ₹100 crore bribe for Goa election expenses and played a significant role in formulating the excise policy. Despite Kejriwal’s claims of political vendetta, the court rejected his bail plea and stated his arrest was due to non-cooperation with the ED's investigation. The Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail until June 1 but restricted his access to the Chief Minister's office and the Delhi Secretariat.</p>
